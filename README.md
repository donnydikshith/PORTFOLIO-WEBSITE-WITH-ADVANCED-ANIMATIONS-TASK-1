**DESCRIPTION OF TASKS PERFORMED**  

1. **Creating the Basic Structure of the Portfolio Website**  
The foundation of the portfolio was built using HTML. The main sections of the website include:  
   - **Header Section:** A welcoming message with navigation links for "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact."  
   - **About Me Section:** Introduced the individual with a brief description, outlining their skills and interests.  
   - **Projects Section:** Dedicated to showcasing completed work or skills with placeholders for future updates.  
   - **Contact Section:** Encouraged users to connect by providing a contact area.  
The content was well-organized to ensure clear navigation and a logical flow.  

2. **Applying Styling for Visual Appeal**  
CSS was used to transform the website into a visually appealing interface. Styling efforts included:  
   - Designing a modern and clean layout with responsive behavior.  
   - Adding background colors, typography adjustments, and spacing for a professional look.  
   - Ensuring proper alignment of the content, making it visually balanced.  
   - Styling cards in the "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact" sections for an elegant appearance.  
This helped create a user-friendly interface that aligns with modern web design principles.  

3. **Integrating Advanced Animations**  
To add interactivity and make the website more engaging, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) was used. The following animations were implemented:  
   - **Header Animation:** The header smoothly fades into view from the top when the page loads.  
   - **Section Animations:** Each section (About Me, Projects, Contact) animates into view as the user scrolls down the page. For example, the "About Me" section slides in from the left, while the "Projects" section slides in from the right.  
   - Animations were created using GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin, which ensures elements animate only when they come into view.  

4. **Adding Smooth Scrolling Functionality**  
To improve the navigation experience, smooth scrolling was implemented using JavaScript. This ensured that clicking on the navigation links (e.g., "About," "Projects," or "Contact") transitioned users smoothly to the respective section instead of a sudden jump.  

5. **Testing and Refining the Website**  
The website was hosted locally using a live server to check functionality and layout. Thorough testing ensured the animations worked seamlessly across all sections and that the styling was responsive and consistent. Adjustments were made to the layout, animations, and styling to create a polished final product.  

6. **Final Touches**  
The completed portfolio website combines a clean design with advanced animations for an interactive user experience. This project demonstrates the use of modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and GSAP, to build a personal brand.
